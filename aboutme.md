title: About me
---

I'm <strong>Jonathan Astermark</strong>, a PhD student at the Division of Computer Vision and Machine Learning at Lund University, supervised by [Viktor Larsson](https://vlarsson.github.io/) and [Anders Heyden](https://scholar.google.se/citations?user=9j-6i_oAAAAJ&hl) and funded by the [ELLIIT project Geometrically Constrained Learning for Vision](https://elliit.se/project/geometrically-constrained-learning-for-vision/). Previously, I obtained my master's degree in Engineering Physics at Lund University in 2019.


My research is on geometry estimation problems in computer vision related to Structure-from-Motion and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping. Specifically, I'm interested in how machine learning and geometry should be combined for efficient and accurate estimation.


In my free time, I enjoy boardgames, skiing, and traveling.
